# Mock API

# Introduction 
Develop a simple RESTful Web API using C# that integrates with the mock API provided at [https://restful-api.dev](https://restful-api.dev/). Your API should extend the functionality of the mock API by adding additional processing or features.

### Technical Requirements:

1. Framework .NET 8.0
2. **API Methods:** Implement at least three API methods:
    1. To retrieve data from the mock API with the ability to filter by name(substring) and paging
    2. To add data to the mock API
    3. To remove data via the mock API
3. **Validation**:
    - Implement proper validation for the model.
    - Ensure all required fields are provided and valid when creating or updating a product.
4. **Error Handling**:
    - Implement proper error handling.
	
	
# Build and Test
- Unzip the folder and open the MockAPI solution in visual studio.
- Clean and rebuild the solution.
- Complete documentation is included in Swagger. The requests are also bulit-in(can be changed), simply execute the endpoints to validate results.
